brew install curl

got cURL error: Timeout was reached 
probably due to the network being slow 
but gonna try to optimize the code to be faster 


So im running into the issue of the code just being really and using up alot memory the longer 
that it keeps running 

Some pontential solutions
Natural language processing could help with finding words closer to my target 
it could help by adding better links to lead to finding the target page faster
issue: i feel like it would take some time to learn, but could be very efficient
